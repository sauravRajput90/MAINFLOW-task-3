Scatter plots: Show data points as points, which are suitable to examine interactions of variables.
Bar charts: Apply to show the categorical data as rectangular bars which are helpful in comparisons.
Histograms: display the graphical representation of numerical data in terms of the frequency of the data points in certain ranges of values.
Pie charts: Show actual size of a whole, applicable to categoric data.
Box plots: Averaging consists in using averages, medians, quartiles, and implementing measures to minimize or exclude extremes if any.
